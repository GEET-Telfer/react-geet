        <b>Purpose of the GEET+</b>: The purpose of the GEET+ Scorecard© is to
        assess the inclusiveness of entrepreneurship programs and courses. Users
        are expected to include stakeholders in entrepreneurship training and
        education, such as instructors and trainers, center and program
        managers, funders, and policymakers.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Participation</b>:On the next page, you'll be provided the
        opportunity to complete the online Gender-Smart Entrepreneurship
        Education and Training Plus (GEET+) Scorecard©. You will be provided
        with instructions about how to complete the assessment. We will ask you
        questions about your entrepreneurship courses and programs and
        (optionally) questions to identify information about yourself. We would
        like to compare differences among groups of users. The assessment in
        English is expected to take approximately 25 minutes to complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Benefits</b>: Participation in this assessment will contribute to
        building a better understanding about inclusive education and training
        to support students and entrepreneurs. Stakeholders will use the
        findings to advance knowledge about programs and policies to support
        diverse students and entrepreneurs. You will receive a summary report of
        your responses through email.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Confidentiality and anonymity</b>: You have our assurance that
        information that you will share will remain strictly confidential. In
        written reports, your name, title, position, and organization will be
        disguised. Responses may, however, be cited in reports about GEET+.
        Personal information will be removed from the data prior to analysis.
        Your responses will be used only for data collection, analysis, and
        report writing. The findings will be presented in reports, at academic
        conferences, and in journal publications or books.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Risks</b>: All efforts will be made to guarantee anonymity in the
        published results. There is a risk that we may disclose confidential or
        otherwise potentially damaging information in comments, since
        participants may be quoted in the published results. However, the
        researchers will make every effort to minimize these risks. This
        includes reviewing quotes prior to publication to ensure that they
        cannot be associated with a study participant.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Access to data</b>: Two researchers and two research assistants will
        have access to the survey data. Research Assistants are required to sign
        a confidentiality agreement prior to involvement in the project.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Conservation of data</b>: The digital survey data collected will be
        kept in a secure manner. The data will be stored on five university
        computers with secure passwords. Only the Principal Investigator,
        Co-Investigator, and two Research Assistants will have access to the
        data. The data will be conserved for a period of 5 years following
        completion of the data collection phase of the study.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Secure connection</b>: To minimize the risk of security breaches and
        to help ensure confidentiality, we encourage you to use standard safety
        measures, such as using a secure connection when completing the survey,
        signing out of your account, and closing the browser and locking the
        screen or device when they are no longer being used and when you have
        completed the survey.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Volunteer participation</b>: You are under no obligation to
        participate. If you choose to participate, you can withdraw from the
        assessment at any time and/or refuse to answer any questions, without
        suffering any negative consequences. You may request that your
        assessment data be removed from the database up to the point of the
        publication of the findings.
